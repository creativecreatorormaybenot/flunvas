# funvas_gallery

Gallery application for the [`funvas` package][funvas], allowing to explore some animations.

## Live demo

The gallery can be reached as a Flutter web app at [funvas.creativemaybeno.dev][gallery].

## Animations

The animations in the gallery are taken from the [`funvas_tweets`][funvas_tweets] package :)
I only selected a subset of the funvas animation from there because they might not all perform well
in the web app.
