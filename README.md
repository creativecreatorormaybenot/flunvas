# funvas [![Pub version][pub shield]][pub] [![gallery badge]][gallery] [![Twitter Follow][twitter badge]][twitter]

Flutter package that allows creating canvas animations based on time and math (mostly trigonometric)
functions.

The name "funvas" is based on Flutter + fun + canvas. Let me know if you have any better ideas :)

## Gallery [![gallery badge]][gallery]

I share my funvas creations [on Twitter][twitter] and I have also created a [live demo][gallery],
a gallery that allows you to explore some of the animations running right in Flutter web :)

## Community projects

Here are some awesome community projects made using the [`funvas` package][pub] to create some ðŸ”¥âœ¨

### Repo structure

This repo currently contains the following packages:

| Package                                                                                          | Contents                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`funvas`](https://github.com/creativecreatorormaybenot/funvas/tree/main/funvas)                 | The actual `funvas` Flutter package that is also hosted on Pub. Both `funvas_tweets` and `funvas_gallery` depend on this package. It contains the basic widget for displaying funvas animations. |
| [`funvas_gallery`](https://github.com/creativecreatorormaybenot/funvas/tree/main/funvas_gallery) | Collection of funvas animations I created and shared [on Twitter][twitter]. The package also contains the code I use to export my animations to GIF and mp4.                                     |
| [`funvas_tweets`](https://github.com/creativecreatorormaybenot/funvas/tree/main/funvas_tweets)   | Flutter web app (gallery) showcasing a selection of `funvas_tweets` funvas animations that can be reached at [funvas.creativemaybeno.dev][gallery].                                              |
| [`open_simplex_2`](https://github.com/creativecreatorormaybenot/funvas/tree/main/open_simplex_2) | Package that makes OpenSimplex2 noise generation available to everyone in Dart :) I use this for my own funvas animations (`funvas_tweets`) but it is also hosted for anyone to use on Pub.      |

### Inspiration

The whole concept is *inspired by Dwitter* ([check it out][dtwitter]). That is mainly the way the
API is built. These kinds of animations (especially in GIF form) can be found in many communities,
e.g. in [processing] (and with that p5.js).
