Flutter package that allows creating canvas animations based on time and math (mostly trigonometric)
functions.

The name "funvas" is based on Flutter + fun + canvas. Let me know if you have any better ideas :)

## [Demo][demo]

I share my funvas creations [on Twitter][Twitter] and I have also create a [live demo][demo] that
allows you to see the animations running right in Flutter web :)

### Inspiration

The whole concept is *inspired by Dwitter* ([check it out][Dwitter]). That is mainly the way the
API is built. These kinds of animations (especially in GIF form) can be found in many communities,
e.g. in [Processing] (and with that p5.js).
